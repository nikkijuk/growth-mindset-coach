# Growth Mindset concept

"Growth mindset" is also called "Get Better mindset". In this mindset challanges are rendered as possibilities to learn. Example: I am able to learn mathematics.

"Fixed mindset" is also called "Be Good mindset". This mindset relates to felt importance of existing knowledge and skills instead of ability to learn. Challanging status quo is problematic as "Fixed mindset" defines person having set of abilities or not. Example: I am mathemarically talented - or then not.
